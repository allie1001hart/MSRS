                        Supporters of the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University led the way in FY18, helping Temple Health close one of its best years in fundraising history on June 30, 2018.  Gifts from donors totaled more than $37 million in support of education, patient care, research and service to the community.

                        The Temple Health fundraising total represents combined philanthropic support for the Lewis Katz School of Medicine and other health system entities, including Fox Chase Cancer Center and Temple University Hospital.

                        “We are grateful to the visionary donors who believe in the mission of the school and the health system, and who have pledged their philanthropic support to help us achieve our goals,” noted Nina Weisbord, chief advancement officer at Temple Health and assistant dean of the Lewis Katz School of medicine.

                        Representing the largest share of the $37 million total, the Katz School of Medicine raised $20 million in support of the school’s top priorities – scholarship, research and student support.

                        Alumni, faculty, staff and friends directed $10 million towards scholarship programs, including the creation of seven new endowed scholarship funds, helping the scholarship endowment grow to $33.5 million and moving the school closer towards the goal of a $50 million scholarship endowment by 2026.

                        Of the year’s seven new endowed scholarships, $7.33 million was recorded in pledged bequests, which will add to the overall scholarship endowment in future years.

                        Other school fundraising highlights in FY18 included several seven-figure gifts towards the establishment of two new Chairs, in support of Alzheimer’s research and Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and to provide ongoing annual operating support for the school’s state-of-the-art Carson Schneck Anatomy Lab.
